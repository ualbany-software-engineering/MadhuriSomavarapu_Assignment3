# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Installed Bootstrap module with command npm install bootstrap
Then imported this into index.js file with command: import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

Created a functional component named Information.js to handle the functionality of entering customer name and his biography.
Everytime the user changes the input the name and biography will be changed and displayed into the review section on the top of the screen.

This functionality is developed with the help react hook called useState.

Now we move on to a new functionality which is fetching the latest news online and making them avaiable to the user.
The user can see the news and then if he/ she is interested they can click on know more option to check out the website to get the whole news.
 
To handle operation of fetching the news data I created a functional component called fetchNews.js
I also used the react-router-dom inorder to route between news screen and the home screen. For this I installed
react-router-dom and then imnported {BrowserRouter, Routes, Route and Link} to the respective js files to use them in the code.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
